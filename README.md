The model and other relevant class functions for Faster RCNN are all located in the python files. The python files are then imported onto the Python notebook, where the training and testing is done.

For reproducing the results, the cells can be run sequentially. Please take note of the directories of datasets, etc. are with respect to our directories.

Before running, you can refer to the images shown in cells as well.
